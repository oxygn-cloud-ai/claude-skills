## Checks

1. Verify `curl` is available: `which curl`
2. Verify `jq` is available: `which jq`
3. Verify `python3` is available: `which python3`
4. Check `rich` is installed: `python3 -c "import rich" 2>/dev/null`
5. Check env vars (report set/not set, **never display values**):
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - `JIRA_EMAIL`
   - `JIRA_API_KEY`
6. Check reference files exist:
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/references/schemas/enums.schema.json`
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/references/business-context.md`
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/references/jira-config.md`
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/references/workflow/step-1-extract.md`
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/references/workflow/step-2-adversarial.md`
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/references/workflow/step-3-rectify.md`
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/references/workflow/step-4-discussion.md`
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/references/workflow/step-5-finalise.md`
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/references/workflow/step-6-publish.md`
7. Check orchestrator scripts exist:
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/orchestrator/rr-batch.sh`
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/orchestrator/retry.sh`
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/orchestrator/monitor.py`
8. Check sub-command files exist:
   - `ls ~/.claude/commands/rr/*.md`
9. Try Atlassian MCP connectivity: attempt `mcp__claude_ai_Atlassian__searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` with JQL `project = RR AND issuetype = Risk` limit 1
