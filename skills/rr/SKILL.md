### doctor

If $ARGUMENTS equals "doctor", "--doctor", or "check", run environment diagnostics and stop.

**Checks:**
1. Verify `curl` is available: `which curl`
2. Verify `jq` is available: `which jq`
3. Check env vars (report set/not set, **never display values**):
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - `JIRA_EMAIL`
   - `JIRA_API_TOKEN`
4. Check reference files exist:
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/references/schemas/enums.schema.json`
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/references/business-context.md`
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/references/jira-config.md`
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/references/workflow/step-1-extract.md`
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/references/workflow/step-2-adversarial.md`
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/references/workflow/step-3-rectify.md`
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/references/workflow/step-4-discussion.md`
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/references/workflow/step-5-finalise.md`
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/references/workflow/step-6-publish.md`
5. Check orchestrator scripts exist:
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/orchestrator/rr-batch.sh`
   - `ls ~/.claude/skills/rr/orchestrator/retry.sh`
6. Check sub-command files exist:
   - `ls ~/.claude/commands/rr/*.md`
7. Try Atlassian MCP connectivity: attempt `mcp__claude_ai_Atlassian__searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` with JQL `project = RR AND issuetype = Risk` limit 1

Format:
```
rr doctor — Environment Health Check

  [PASS] curl: /usr/bin/curl
  [PASS] jq: /usr/local/bin/jq
  [PASS] ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: set
  [WARN] JIRA_EMAIL: not set
  [WARN] JIRA_API_TOKEN: not set
  [PASS] reference files: 9 files found
  [PASS] orchestrator scripts: 2 files found
  [PASS] sub-commands: 4 files in ~/.claude/commands/rr/
  [PASS] Atlassian MCP: connected (1 result)
  [PASS] version: 2.0.0

  Result: N passed, N warnings, N failed
```

End of doctor output. Do not continue.

### version

If $ARGUMENTS equals "version", "--version", or "-v", output the version and stop.

```
rr v2.0.0
```

End of version output. Do not continue.

### update

If $ARGUMENTS equals "update", "--update", or "upgrade":

1. Read the source repo path from `~/.claude/skills/rr/.source-repo`
2. If found:
   - `cd` to the repo path
   - `git pull`
   - Compare installed version (from this SKILL.md frontmatter) with repo version
   - If different: run `bash install.sh --force` from the repo
   - If same: report already at latest
3. If `.source-repo` not found:
   ```
   rr update — source repo not configured.
   Clone the repo and run install.sh to set up the source link:
     git clone <repo-url>
     cd <repo-dir>
     bash install.sh
   ```

End of update output. Do not continue.

## Pre-flight Checks

Before executing, silently verify:

1. **Reference files readable**: Check that `~/.claude/skills/rr/references/schemas/enums.schema.json` exists. If not:
   > **rr error**: Reference files not found at ~/.claude/skills/rr/references/. Run `/rr doctor` to diagnose.

2. **Sub-commands installed**: `ls ~/.claude/commands/rr/*.md` finds files. If not:
   > **rr warning**: Sub-command files not found in ~/.claude/commands/rr/. Running inline.

---

## Routing

Parse $ARGUMENTS and route:

| Argument | Action |
|----------|--------|
| (empty) | Show help (same as `help` subcommand above) |
| `help`, `--help`, `-h` | Show help (handled in Subcommands above) |
| `doctor`, `--doctor`, `check` | Run diagnostics (handled in Subcommands above) |
| `version`, `--version`, `-v` | Show version (handled in Subcommands above) |
| `update` | Check for updates (handled in Subcommands above) |
| Pattern matching `RR-\d+` (case-insensitive) | Invoke `/rr:review` via Skill tool, passing the full $ARGUMENTS |
| `all` (with optional flags/filters after) | Invoke `/rr:all` via Skill tool, passing everything after `all` |
| `status` | Invoke `/rr:status` via Skill tool |
| `fix` | Invoke `/rr:fix` via Skill tool |
| anything else | Show help |

If the sub-command `.md` files exist in `~/.claude/commands/rr/`, invoke them via the Skill tool. Otherwise, execute the logic inline using the workflow overview below.

## Single Risk Workflow Overview

If sub-command files are not installed, use this inline fallback. Each step reads its detailed instructions from the reference files.

### Step 1 — Extract and Draft
Read: `~/.claude/skills/rr/references/workflow/step-1-extract.md`
Retrieve target risk from Jira, fetch child tickets, export to JSON, draft initial assessment.

### Step 2 — Adversarial Review
Read: `~/.claude/skills/rr/references/workflow/step-2-adversarial.md`
Challenge Assessment 1 against 8 criteria. Verify regulatory citations via web search.

### Step 3 — Rectified Assessment
Read: `~/.claude/skills/rr/references/workflow/step-3-rectify.md`
Address every challenge from Step 2. Track changes in `changes_from_previous`.

### Step 4 — Discussion
Read: `~/.claude/skills/rr/references/workflow/step-4-discussion.md`
Initiate discussion with user. Ask about unresolved points one at a time. Do NOT wait passively.

### Step 5 — Final Assessment
Read: `~/.claude/skills/rr/references/workflow/step-5-finalise.md`
Incorporate discussion outcomes. Produce final assessment. **Wait for user confirmation** before Step 6.

### Step 6 — Publish to Jira
Read: `~/.claude/skills/rr/references/workflow/step-6-publish.md`
Check for existing same-day Review. Create or update Review child ticket. Attach workflow files.

## File Naming Convention

All files saved to `${RR_OUTPUT_DIR:-~/rr-output}/`:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `<key>_export.json` | `rr-220_export.json` |
| `<key>_<date>_assessment_1.json` | `rr-220_2026-04-02_assessment_1.json` |
| `<key>_<date>_adversarial_review.json` | `rr-220_2026-04-02_adversarial_review.json` |
| `<key>_<date>_assessment_2.json` | `rr-220_2026-04-02_assessment_2.json` |
| `<key>_<date>_discussion.json` | `rr-220_2026-04-02_discussion.json` |
| `<key>_<date>_assessment_final.json` | `rr-220_2026-04-02_assessment_final.json` |
| `<key>_<date>_jira_ticket.json` | `rr-220_2026-04-02_jira_ticket.json` |

- `<key>`: Lowercase with hyphen (e.g., `rr-220`)
- `<date>`: ISO format `yyyy-mm-dd`

## Validation

Before each step, validate the previous step's output:

1. JSON parses successfully
2. Required fields present
3. Enum values match allowed lists
4. Ratings follow the matrix

If validation fails, halt and report the error.

## Prohibited Actions

- Do not modify the parent Risk item
- Do not modify existing Mitigation or Review tickets
- Do not assign tickets unless instructed
- Do not fabricate regulatory citations
- Do not proceed past Step 5 without user confirmation
