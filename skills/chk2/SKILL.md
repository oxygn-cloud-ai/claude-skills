End of help output. Do not continue.

### doctor

If $ARGUMENTS equals "doctor", "--doctor", or "check", run environment diagnostics and stop.

**Checks:**
1. Verify `curl` is available: `which curl`
2. Verify `dig` is available: `which dig`
3. Verify `openssl` is available: `which openssl`
4. Verify `python3` is available: `which python3`
5. Verify `websockets` python package: `python3 -c "import websockets" 2>&1`
6. Verify target is reachable: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://myzr.io/`
7. Verify sub-command files exist: `ls ~/.claude/commands/chk2/*.md`
8. Report installed skill version

Format:
```
chk2 doctor — Environment Health Check

  [PASS] curl: /usr/bin/curl
  [PASS] dig: /usr/bin/dig
  [PASS] openssl: /usr/bin/openssl
  [PASS] python3: /usr/bin/python3
  [PASS] websockets: installed
  [PASS] target reachable: https://myzr.io/ (200)
  [PASS] sub-commands: 33 files in ~/.claude/commands/chk2/
  [PASS] version: 2.0.0

  Result: N passed, N warnings, N failed
```

End of doctor output. Do not continue.

### version

If $ARGUMENTS equals "version", "--version", or "-v", output the version and stop.

```
chk2 v2.0.0
```

End of version output. Do not continue.

---

## Pre-flight Checks

Before executing, silently verify:

1. **curl available**: `which curl`. If not found:
   > **chk2 error**: curl is not installed or not in PATH.

2. **Target reachable**: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://myzr.io/` returns 200. If not:
   > **chk2 error**: Target https://myzr.io/ is not reachable (HTTP {code}). Check the server is running.

3. **Sub-commands installed**: `ls ~/.claude/commands/chk2/*.md` finds files. If not:
   > **chk2 warning**: Sub-command files not found in ~/.claude/commands/chk2/. Running inline.

---

## Routing

The target URL is `https://myzr.io` unless the environment variable `CHK2_TARGET` is set.

Parse $ARGUMENTS and route:

| `quick` | Run headers, tls, dns, cors only (skip WS tests in cors) |
| `headers` | Run Headers category |
| `tls` | Run TLS category |
| `dns` | Run DNS category |
| `cors` | Run CORS category |
| `api` | Run API category |
| `ws` | Run WebSocket category |
| `waf` | Run WAF category |
| `infra` | Run Infrastructure category |
| `brute` | Run Brute Force category |
| `scale` | Run Scaling category |
| `disclosure` | Run Disclosure category |
| `cookies` | Run Cookies category |
| `cache` | Run Cache category |
| `smuggling` | Run Smuggling category |
| `auth` | Run Auth category |
| `transport` | Run Transport category |
| `redirect` | Run Redirect category |
| `fingerprint` | Run Fingerprint category |
| `hardening` | Run Hardening category |
| `negotiation` | Run Negotiation category |

| `jwt` | Run JWT/Token Security category |
| `graphql` | Run GraphQL category |
| `sse` | Run SSE Security category |
| `ipv6` | Run IPv6 Security category |
| `reporting` | Run Reporting & Compliance category |
| `fix` | Run Fix helper (reads existing SECURITY_CHECK.md) |

If the sub-command `.md` files exist in `~/.claude/commands/chk2/`, invoke them via the Skill tool. Otherwise, execute the tests inline using the definitions below.

## Output Format

All results are written to `SECURITY_CHECK.md` in the repo root.

Initialize with:
```markdown
# Security Check — myzr.io

**Date**: {current UTC date and time}
**Tests run**: {category or "all"}
**Target**: https://myzr.io
```

Each category appends:
```markdown
### {Category Name}

| # | Test | Result | Evidence |
|---|------|--------|----------|
| {id} | {test name} | PASS/FAIL/WARN | {brief evidence} |
```

After all categories, append:
```markdown
## Summary

| Category | Pass | Fail | Warn | Total |
|----------|------|------|------|-------|
| ... |

**Overall**: X passed, Y failed, Z warnings out of N tests

## Recommendations

{Numbered list of actionable fixes for FAIL/WARN items, ordered by severity}
```

---

## After Every Run

After completing any test category (or all), ask the user:

> **Do you want help fixing the issues found?** If yes, I'll walk through each FAIL and WARN item with specific code changes, Cloudflare config steps, and verification commands.

If the user says yes, invoke `/chk2:fix` (or run the fix logic inline if sub-commands aren't installed).

---

## Rate Limit Handling

If any test returns HTTP 429 or Cloudflare error 1015:
1. Log: `[RATE LIMITED] Waiting 65 seconds...`
2. Wait 65 seconds
3. Retry the request once
4. If still rate limited, mark the test as `WARN — rate limited, could not test`

---

## Test Category Definitions

If sub-command files are not installed, use these inline definitions. Each category lists the tests to run, the pass conditions, and the output format. See the sub-command files in `~/.claude/commands/chk2/` for the full test specifications — they are the authoritative source.

## Update Subcommand

If $ARGUMENTS equals "update", "--update", or "upgrade":

1. Read the current version from the installed SKILL.md
2. Attempt to download the latest version:
   ```bash
   REPO="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxygn-cloud-ai/claude-skills/main"
   REMOTE_VER=$(curl -s "$REPO/skills/chk2/SKILL.md" | grep -m1 '^version:' | sed 's/^version: *//')
   ```
3. If the remote version matches the installed version:
   ```
   chk2 update — already at v2.0.0 (latest)
   ```
4. If a newer version is available, download all files:
   ```bash
   curl -sL "$REPO/skills/chk2/SKILL.md" -o ~/.claude/skills/chk2/SKILL.md
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands/chk2
   for f in all quick headers tls dns cors api ws waf infra brute scale disclosure fix cookies cache smuggling auth transport redirect fingerprint timing compression jwt graphql sse ipv6 reporting hardening negotiation proxy business backend; do
     curl -sL "$REPO/skills/chk2/commands/${f}.md" -o ~/.claude/commands/chk2/${f}.md
   done
   ```
5. Report the update:
   ```
   chk2 update — Updated from vX.Y.Z to vA.B.C (33 sub-commands installed)
   Restart Claude Code to pick up changes.
   ```

End of update output. Do not continue.
