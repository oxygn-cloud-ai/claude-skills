# chk2 — Adversarial Security Audit

A Claude Code skill that runs comprehensive security audits against web services. Tests across 30 categories with ~209 individual checks, outputs a scored report, and offers guided remediation.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed
- `curl`, `dig`, `openssl` (standard on macOS/Linux)
- `python3` with `websockets` package (`pip3 install websockets`)

## Installation

### From repo root (recommended)

```bash
./install.sh chk2
```

### Standalone (from skill directory)

```bash
cd skills/chk2
./install.sh
```

### Manual (no clone needed)

```bash
# Main skill
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/chk2
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxygn-cloud-ai/claude-skills/main/skills/chk2/SKILL.md \
  -o ~/.claude/skills/chk2/SKILL.md

# Sub-commands
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands/chk2
for f in all headers tls dns cors api ws waf infra brute scale disclosure quick fix; do
  curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxygn-cloud-ai/claude-skills/main/skills/chk2/commands/${f}.md" \
    -o ~/.claude/commands/chk2/${f}.md
done
```

## Usage

In Claude Code:

```
/chk2                Run all test categories (~100 checks)
/chk2 all            Same as above
/chk2 quick          Fast passive-only subset (headers+tls+dns+cors)
/chk2 headers        HTTP security headers (14 checks)
/chk2 tls            TLS/SSL configuration (9 checks)
/chk2 dns            DNS, DNSSEC, email security (10 checks)
/chk2 cors           CORS and origin validation (8 checks)
/chk2 api            API fuzzing, injection, type confusion (12 checks)
/chk2 ws             WebSocket security (10 checks)
/chk2 waf            WAF rules and rate limiting (10 checks)
/chk2 infra          Cloudflare infrastructure (12 checks)
/chk2 brute          Session enumeration (8 checks)
/chk2 scale          Connection limits, payload sizes (6 checks)
/chk2 disclosure     Information disclosure (10 checks)
/chk2 fix            Deep resolution helper for failed checks
/chk2 doctor         Check environment health
/chk2 help           Display usage guide
```

## What it does

Runs adversarial security tests against a target web service and produces `SECURITY_CHECK.md` with PASS/FAIL/WARN results and evidence for every check.

### Test categories

| Category | Checks | What it tests |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| headers | 14 | HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, CORS, referrer policy |
| tls | 9 | TLS versions, ciphers, OCSP, certificate validity |
| dns | 10 | DNSSEC, SPF, DMARC, CAA, NS records |
| cors | 8 | CORS policy, preflight, WebSocket origin validation |
| api | 12 | Injection (SQLi, NoSQL, prototype pollution, command, template), fuzzing |
| ws | 10 | Origin check, connection limits, message flood, binary frames |
| waf | 10 | Scanner UA blocking, rate limiting, method restrictions |
| infra | 12 | CF config, source exposure, path traversal, error page leaks |
| brute | 8 | Session ID entropy, pair code strength, enumeration resistance |
| scale | 6 | Payload limits, nesting depth, concurrent connections |
| disclosure | 10 | Error pages, stack traces, version headers, data exposure |

### Fix helper

After any test run, say "yes" when asked **"Do you want help fixing this?"** to get:

- Exact Cloudflare dashboard paths and settings
- Copy-pasteable server code fixes
- DNS record changes
- Verification commands for each fix
- Fixes grouped by effort level (instant / quick / deeper)

## Installs to

```
~/.claude/skills/chk2/SKILL.md          Main skill
~/.claude/commands/chk2.md              Router (dispatches to sub-commands)
~/.claude/commands/chk2/*.md            14 sub-command files
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Skill not appearing | `ls ~/.claude/skills/chk2/SKILL.md` |
| Sub-commands not found | `ls ~/.claude/commands/chk2/*.md` |
| WebSocket tests fail | `pip3 install websockets` |
| Rate limited during tests | Tests auto-retry after 65s wait |
| Target unreachable | Check server is running, try `/chk2 doctor` |
